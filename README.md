# Battleships Game

Implemented a simple one-sided game of battleships against a computer. There is a 10x10 map and 3 ships are placed randomly on it. The player guesses where a ship is located by 'shooting' at chosen coordinates. The objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
